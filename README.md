# GIAIC Projects and Assignments

This repository contains the code for various projects and assignments I have completed independently during the **Governor Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (GIAIC)** program. The tasks and challenges provided by our teachers helped strengthen my understanding of several core concepts in programming and cloud-based generative AI.

## About

This repository is a collection of projects and assignments I’ve worked on throughout the GIAIC course. Each project showcases the skills and knowledge I’ve gained in areas such as TypeScript, Cloud Development, Generative AI, and Full-Stack Web Development. All of the work here has been completed independently as part of my learning journey.
